# Shoebases - Quiz Application

This repository contains a Python quiz application for a hypothetical shoe store named "Shoebases" The original code was provided by a friend who is still learning programming, and I helped enhance its functionality. The application simulates a shoe purchasing system, allowing users to input shoe codes, quantities, and see the total cost of their purchases.

## Features

- **Product Information:** The code includes information about different types of shoes, their colors, and corresponding prices, stored in a list.
- **Functions:** User-defined functions (`jenis_sepatu`, `warna_sepatu`, `harga_satuan`) have been implemented to map shoe codes to their types, colors, and prices.
- **User Input:** The application takes user input for the number of shoes to buy and individual shoe codes. It calculates the total cost based on user inputs.
- **Integration Test:** An integration test has been added to ensure the application's components work together correctly.

## Code Explanation

- **Functionality Improvements:** The original code provided by the friend has been enhanced to include functions, better variable naming, and error handling.
- **Modular Design:** The code is structured to facilitate code readability and maintainability.
- **Learning Focus:** The enhancements aim to help the original author understand concepts such as dictionaries, lists, and user-defined functions.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sepatu-cool-quiz.git
